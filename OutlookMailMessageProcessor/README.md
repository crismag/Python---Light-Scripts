# OutlookMailMessageProcessor

Some code to:
1. Read an outlook msg file and extract the attachments out of it and save it to a folder.
2. Collect the PDF attachments and combine it.
3. Append the msg file as a pdf file and append it to the last page of combined msg file.

Note:
  All the codes were refectored using ChatGPT before adding it here.
  These usually creates new set of errors and sometimes incorrect translations of the code.
  It looks nicer and cleaner though!!!

Good luck. Happy to work with whomever is using it.
